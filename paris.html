            <h3>Best Time to Visit:</h3> 
            <ul> 
                <li>Spring (April to June) and Fall (September to October)</li> 
                are the best times to visit Paris, as the weather is mild, the 
                parks are beautiful, and the crowds are smaller than in the peak summer months. <br> 
                <li>Summer (July to August)</li> 
                is high tourist season, so expect larger crowds and higher prices, but the weather is generally 
                warm and ideal for outdoor activities. <br> 
                <li>Winter (December to February)</li> is colder, but it's a magical time to visit for holiday lights, fewer tourists, and cozy cafés.
